<p>
In this directory you will find the calibration tool for
calibrating the temperature setting of MeterOS
</p>
<p>
  To do it manually you will need to do linear regression. with x being <b>ln(resistance)</b>
  and y being <b>1/(temperature_in_kelvins)</b>
</p>
<p>
  The thermistor connects to the same analog pin that is used for measuring resistance. You
  can use the windows or linux version of the tool to do the math for you,
